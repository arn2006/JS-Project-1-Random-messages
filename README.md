The purpose of this project is to generate a random text-message, which starts with a greeting, following a unrealistic shopping list.
The length of the shoppinglist has a random value from 1 to 15. 
Each list-element contains a random number and a food-item.
The number is ranging from 1 to 10, representing how many food items that must be baught.
The food item is first selected from a food-category, and then from a list within that category.
